# My Dotfiles

Those are my dotfiles, there are many like them but those are mine.<br>
Without me my dotfiles are useless (not really),<br>without them, I am useless 
(not really either, just annoyed for not having my settings...)

### Suggested install:

    git clone git@github.com:JohnMoutafis/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
    pip install dotbot
    dotbot -c ~/.dotfiles/install.conf.yaml
